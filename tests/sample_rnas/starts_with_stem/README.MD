found this on forna gallery where they wanted 
to introduce me to pseudoknots and [] notations.
I do not want to aknlowedge existence of that
just yet to not overflow the capacity of my
monkey brain. I delete all the pesky square
brackets and boom what a beautiful example
of rna that starts off with a shaft XD.
